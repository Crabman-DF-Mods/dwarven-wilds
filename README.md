# Dwarven Wilds - v0.1.0 [47.05]

_NOT AN OFFICIAL OUTER WILDS PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOBIUS DIGITAL OR ANNAPURNA INTERACTIVE._

This mod for [Dwarf Fortress][Dwarf_Fortress] adds the unique creatures, civilizations, and materials seen and/or mentioned in [Outer Wilds][Source] and its DLC, Echoes of the Eye.

__Be warned__, Outer Wilds is a game whose fun comes from discovery and gaining knowledge through exploration of the world, and __over half of this mod's contents would count as spoilers for both the main game and DLC__, and this would likely impact the enjoyability of the game.

__Therefore I highly recommend that you first play Outer Wilds (and its DLC, Echoes of the Eye) before using the full version of this mod.__ Strictly speaking you wouldn't need to play all the way to the end to find everything that is in this mod, but unfortunately I can't be specific about what "the safe points" are without that also being a spoiler.

__The raw files comments have even more spoilers (including story ones!) than you would get just playing with the mod__, so be warned about that before you go digging around this mod's code.

Technically one of the base game creatures/civs I have listed in the spoiler warning below is not a proper spoiler since you find out about them in the museum before you can even get in your spaceship, but their culture (and by extension their personalities) _is_ a spoiler, which is why they are absent from the spoiler free version of this mod.

This mod was created with the help of the [Dwarf Fortress RAW language server extension][LS], which is currently in alpha, but I still recommend it for anyone wanting to make Dwarf Fortress mods, either for the first time or as a veteran.

## Installation

There are 3 folders here, each for a different version of the mod:

- __Full Mod:__ contains all this mods content, including all spoilery things from both the base game and DLC.
- __Only Base Game Spoilers:__ contains all the same content as Full Mod, _except_ the content from the Echoes of the Eye DLC.
- __Spoiler Free:__ contains none of the spoilery content; that is, it only has the "hearthian" creatures/civ, and the "ghost matter" material (which aren't spoilers because you find out about them at the start of the game).

Decide which of those versions you want, and copy-paste all the files in the corresponding folder into `/raw/objects/`. If you ever decide to change to a different, more spoilery version, you must make sure to overwrite any files that are shared between the versions (you should get a prompt asking you about overwriting files when you copy them in; say yes to all overwrites).

## Content

### Base Game

Hearthians: intrepid blue-skinned creatures driven by intense curiosity; they have a natural knack for the acquisition of knowledge and tend to be quite friendly. Their culture puts a heavy emphasis on community and exploration.

Ghost Matter: a deadly transparent substance that cannot be seen easily with the naked eye; it will inflict a painful death on anybody who wanders into a cloud of it unwittingly. Beware of encountering it while mining!

  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  Nomai: 3 eyed, goatlike people who are natural scientists with great interest in understanding the world. Their culture harbors a deep respect for nature, and reinforces their natural interest in learning.

  Star Platinum: strange ore that looks like rock embedded with glowing stars; in the dark it resembles the night sky. It can temporarily withstand the hottest flame in existence, dragonfire!

  Giants Deep Jellyfish: gigantic orange jellyfish with electrified bodies and tentacles. They will assuredly make you sick if you try eating them, even if their electricity is removed.

  Bramble Anglerfish: flying, blind fish that can survive without any oxygen, and which are big enough to swallow a small whale in principle (due to limitations in DF's engine though, they sadly can't do this, yet).

### Echoes of the Eye

  Owlk: large owl-like people with antlers and hooves, who dwell in wetland and forest cities, traveling primarily by river; they have a somewhat traditionalist nature, being slightly fearful, vengeful and reserved, and their culture emphasizes further the importance of tradition and the harmonious lives they so value.
